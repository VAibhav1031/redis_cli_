# This  is  the  simple..and..nice Redis-CLI

Breif about this  project, it is just simple idea based project, i was working on Tree Data Structure using AVL, Splay and many other
then i thought why not to make something out of it , then i try to make  simple  library called SortedMap, just like you seein C++ 
It went nice very with all good features and Error Handling , still that is 9 /10  

then i came  to know this  redis (cache based database) also use some datastructure  for managing , and modules ( like for graph, Search (Emulating ElasticSearch), Document based multi datas (like MongoDb) and many other modules)

which make redis one place all work  being done,  so that is why it is good in use, 

coming to this Redis-CLI it is like i want to built same key and value setting  in Real Redis-CLI,  then i need little bit to setup 
it like REPL shell, and i built , just some interesting stuff nothing else
