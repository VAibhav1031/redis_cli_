# This  is  the  simple..and..nice  Redis like CLI

Breif about this  project, it is just simple idea based project, i was working on Tree Data Structure using AVL, Splay and many other
then i thought why not to make something out of it , then i try to make  simple  library called SortedMap, just like you seein C++ 
It went nice very with all good features and Error Handling , still that is 9 /10  

then i came  to know this  redis (cache based database) also use some datastructure  for managing , and modules ( like for graph, Search (Emulating ElasticSearch), Document based multi datas (like MongoDb) and many other modules)
which make redis one place all work  being done,  so that is why it is good in use, 

coming to this Redis-CLI , which i want to make by executing few of its feature , it is like i want to built same key and value setting  in Real Redis-CLI,  
it like REPL shell, and i built , just some interesting stuff nothing else 
IT is also have socket base connection  to the server and client , i will add more to it and then full stop , cause it is jusst side project , you can use it
